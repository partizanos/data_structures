 data structure
  Hash Table  
    map key to values 
    (also called Table or Map Abstract Data Type/ADT). 
  
  It uses a hash function 
  to map large or even non-Integer keys 
  into a small range of Integer indices 
  (typically [0..hash_table_size-1]).
  
  #quantization problem
  # IDEAS
  # curse of dimensioanality
  # the more data we have the better the estimation
  # variational entropy inference quantization
  
  #  Problem:
    The probability of two distinct keys colliding into the same index 
    is relatively high each of this potential collision 
    needs to be resolved to maintain data integrity.


  # solutions 
  There are several collision resolution strategies 
  that will be highlighted in this 
  visualization: Open Addressing 
  (
    Linear Probing, 
    Quadratic Probing, 
    and Double Hashing
  ) and Closed Addressing (
    Separate Chaining
  ). Try clicking Search(8) for a sample animation of searching a value in a Hash Table using Separate Chaining technique.
